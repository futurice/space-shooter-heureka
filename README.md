# Space Shooter Heureka

This is a simple arcade-style space shooter game which was installed on the Heureka Science Center planetarium for the FutuParty 2016.

## Tools

Developed on Unity3D pro v5.4.1.
Planetarium dome projection mapping was done using [Omnidome](http://omnido.me/).

Read more details about the calibration setup from [/setup/README.md](setup/README.md).

## Required Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for the project to work and have open source licenses. The dependencies are included with the project under the Assets/Plugins folder.

-   [Funnel](https://github.com/keijiro/Funnel) for Syphon-server-support ([license](https://github.com/keijiro/Funnel))
-   [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com) ([licence](http://dotween.demigiant.com/license.php))
-   [UniRX](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) ([license](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx/blob/master/LICENSE))

Because of licensing issues, we had to remove `Assets/Fonts/SharpSansNo1`. Unity should fall back to a builtin font, but in case it does not, please replace the font and send a PR our way!

## Optional Dependencies

The following plugins improve the game experience, but are not open source and might require purchasing.

-   [RTVoice](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/41068) for TTS support.

## Graphical assets and 3d models

Mostly developed by Futurice, but there are few remaining assets released by Unity as part of their demo assets, which are licensed under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license. See full file list [here](LICENSE-EXT-ASSETS).

## Running

-   Decide the resolution (how many projectors are you using?).
    -   Resolution of the application is currently hardcoded in the app and also to _Unity > Player Settings_
    -   Current resolution is 1920x2160 (2 x FullHD on top of each other)
-   Build the game using Unity3d
-   if used with omnidome, output the syphon/funnel output to omnidome. And naturally calibrate the dome.
    -   Currently Syphon is always enabled in the final build using a platform #define directive
