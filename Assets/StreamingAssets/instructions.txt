Welcome Space Cadets! This is Admiral Marcus, Commander of the USS Futurice.
You've all applied to the most demanding aircraft simulation ever built.
Now shut up and listen.
Your currently holding a control panel for the most modern fighter aircraft known to man, fission-fueled dual-engine Chilicorn. 
You can launch missiles by pressing the A-button. When destroyed by the enemy you can return to the battle by pressing the B-button. You control your fighter with the stick on your left. 
Now pay attention! To succeed in this mission you need to outsmart your opponent and gather as much objects as you possibly can. Also destroying the asteroids might get you some advantage. Do you got it now?
Now get seated and shut up, we're launching in t minus ten seconds.
