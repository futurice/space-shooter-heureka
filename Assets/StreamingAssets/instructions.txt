Welcome Space Cadets! This is Admiral Marcus, Commander of the USS Futurice.
You've all applied to the most demanding aircraft simulation ever built.
Now listen up, I'm not going to repeat myself.
Your currently holding a control panel for the most modern fighter aircraft known to man, fission-fueled dual-engine Chiligrafthrmrhm. You can launch missiles by pressing the X-button. When destroyed by the enemy you can return to the battle by pressing the Y-button. You control your fighter with the stick on your left. 
Now pay attention! To succeed in this mission you need to outsmart your opponent and gather as much objects as you possibly can. Also destroying the asteroids might get you some advantage. Do you thick heads got it now?
Now get seated and shut up, we're going live in t minus ten seconds.
